        The hope is that this will provide a fun and easy way to find, view, and
        select dogs looking for their forever home. AdoptADog was developed by
        Peter Bishop, Ryan Geisreiter, Joshua Abeyta, and Taylor Smith. We
        wanted to incorporate our love of dogs into a useful app that could be
        used to find a dog to adopt for any current or future dog owner.
